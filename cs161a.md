  <h4> CS161ACE Info </h4>
<p>
Additional Courses for Engineers (ACE) is designed to provide a solid foundation in mathematics, computational math in engineering, and computer science to undergraduate students interested in pursuing an engineering degree. The mission of ACE is to provide our students, particularly those from under-resourced backgrounds, with the opportunities and support to succeed in their course and in their major. ACE sections, instruction, and the ACE Course Assistants (CAâ€™s) are intentional about fostering environments based on purposeful engagement and inclusive teaching practices. Students selected to participate in ACE are those whose application demonstrates the most significant need or have not had access to institutional resources, exposure, or instruction related to Calculus and/or Computer Science.
You can find more information about ACE, including instructions about how to apply, <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/student-success-and-engagement/undergraduate-programs/additional-courses">here</a>.  Our ACE CA is Auddithio Nag.

<p>
CS161ACE is a 1-unit supplementary section; attendance is mandatory. The focus of the class is on algorithm design and problem solving. CS161ACE does not replace any components of CS 161 - students are still expected to attend CS 161 lecture and section.

<!--
If you are interested in joining the ACE section, please apply <a href="#">here</a>! Note that the main deadlines have already passed, but you are still welcome to apply to get on the waitlist. If you have any further questions about ACE, you can ask our ACE CA, [TBD]. -->
