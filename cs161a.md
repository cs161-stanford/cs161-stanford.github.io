  <h4> CS161A Info </h4>
<p>
Additional Calculus for Engineers (ACE) is one of the School of Engineeringâ€™s Equity and Inclusion Initiatives, designed to provide the skills and solid foundation in mathematics, computational math in engineering, and computer science to undergraduate students interested in pursuing an engineering degree. The goal of ACE is to increase confidence and content knowledge through small group interactive sessions and additional academic resources provided to students enrolled in the program. We especially want to provide an opportunity for students who come from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds or for anyone who feels they might need additional support in order to succeed. We limit enrollment to enable small classes that allow students to have one-on-one interactions with the CA.

<p>
CS 161A is a 1-unit supplementary section; attendance is mandatory. The focus of the class is on algorithm design and problem solving. CS 161A does not replace any components of CS 161 - students are still expected to attend CS 161 lecture and section.
