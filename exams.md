# Exams


<div class="panel">
<h5 class="card-title">Exam Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li> There are three in-person exams.</li>
<li> Note the policy about exam conflicts in the <a href="/policies/">Late Homework and Missed Exams Policy</a>. tl;dr <b>DON'T MISS THE EXAMS.</b></li>
<li> The exams are closed-book except for a cheat sheet.  For exams 1 and 2, this can be two double-sided sheets of paper with anything written on them, and which you have prepared yourself.  For the final exam, you may use three double-sided sheets of paper. 
<ul> 
<li> It is okay to type your cheat sheet if you want.</li>
<li> There is no limit on font size, but no magnifying glasses are allowed in the exam :) </li> 
<li> If you need to print out your cheat sheet, make sure you do it well in advance of the exam.  (In particular, don't rely on CardinalPrint to be working at the last minute....)</li>
</ul></li>
