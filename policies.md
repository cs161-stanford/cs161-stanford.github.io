	The elements of your grade are:
	<ul>
		<li> 7 homework assignments (21%, or 3% each).</li>
		<li> One "pre-HW assignment" (1%), graded for completion.</li>
		<li> Exam I (Oct 16) (22%)</li>
		<li> Exam II (Nov 6) (22%)</li>
		<li> Final Exam (TBD) (34%)</li>
                <li> Bonus Points (see Bonus Point Policy below).</li>
	</ul>

Your score on each assignment will be normalized to become a number (points scored)/(points possible) between 0 and 1, and these numbers will be added together with the above weights to obtain your final numerical grade. The numerical grade will be converted to a letter grade at the end of the course. The final distribution will depend on the class's performance; typically the median is a B+.

After your final numerical grade and letter grade has been computed, the Bonus Point Policy (below) will be enacted, which can boost your final letter grade.

<ul>
<li>The HW assignments will be submitted in small groups (up to three). It is fine and good to discuss between groups (please acknowledge your collaborators), but each group must type up their solutions on their own, from scratch.
	<ul>
	<li>The following is OK: Your group and another group work through the problems together over a couple of days. You bounce ideas off each other, and eventually come up with a pretty good solution idea. You and your group type up that idea in your own words, perhaps lightly consulting notes you took while working with the other group.</li>
	<li>The following is NOT OK: Your group and another group work through the problems together over a couple of days. You bounce ideas off each other, and eventually come up with a pretty good solution idea. Your group types up the solutions first. Since the other group helped, you share your write-up with them as a starting point for their own write-up.</li>
	<li>A good test: if you ever share your typed-up solutions with another group, or if someone shares theirs with you, it is probably NOT OKAY.
Collaboration outside of this quarter's CS161 class is not allowed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
No collaboration is permitted on exams.

Please check with the course staff if you have questions about what collaboration is or is not permitted.

      <div class="card-body">
LLMs are a useful tool, but they can also be a crutch.  In this class, we want to encourage you to learn how to effectively use LLMs as a tool, while still giving you incentives to learn the material yourself.  
<ul><li> <i> Aside: Why should you learn the material yourself if LLMs can do lots of it? </i> LLMs currently can't do as well at algorithm design and analysis as skilled humans at the highest level, and Mary would argue that they won't in the near future (keeping in mind that humans get more powerful as our tools get more powerful).  If you want to eventually be an algorithmically-high-skilled human, you'll need to learn the basics so that you can surpass LLMs (possibly by using LLMs).  Also, in the short term, LLMs still make mistakes, and if you hand in buggy AI slop you'll get a bad grade.
</li></ul>
<br>
With that in mind, the policy is:
<ul>
<li> You are allowed to use LLMs for homework. <b>However,</b> we want you to be thoughtful about how you use them.  To that end:
<ul><li>Homework questions may even have a recommendation for how to use LLMs, for example "try to do this without LLMs," or "use an LLM to generate some ideas and refine them yourself," or "come up with some ideas yourself and use an LLM to refine them."  </li>
<li>These are only suggestions, and you can do what you think is best for your learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> You are <b>not</b> allowed to use LLMs on the exams.  It is a violation of the honor code to use LLMs, or any other resource other than your cheat-sheet, during the exams.
	<ul>
	<li>The exams are the incentive for you to follow our suggestions (or whatever you think is best for your <i>learning</i>) on the homework.</li>
	</ul></li>

	More generally than the collaboration policy and LLM policy, we expect students to follow the <a href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-guidance/honor-code">Stanford Honor Code</a>.  If we have reason to believe that you are in violation of the honor code, including violation of the Collaboration Policy or LLM Policy, we will follow University policy to report it to the Office of Community Standards.

      <div class="card-body">
	<b>Homework:</b>
	<ul>
		<li> You have six late days to distribute as you like among the seven homework assignments, with a <b>maximum of two late days per assignment</b>. Each late day is an extension of 24 hours.  Late days round up, so if you are 30 hours late, that is two late days.  <b>You are responsible for keeping track of late days</b></li>
		<li> The point of late days is to give you flexibility to deal with extenuating circumstances (illness, travel, etc). Do not ask for an extension if you still have late days left; this is what late days are for.</li>
		<li> No credit will be given for homework turned in more than two days after the due date, or for late homework after all late days have been used.</li>
		<li> If you join the class late, you will receive a zero on any missed homework assignments.  (Except HW0, which you can complete at any time).</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Exams:</b>
	<ul>
		<li> Please do not miss the exams!  If you know you will have a conflict, please email <a href="mailto:cs161-aut2526-staff@lists.stanford.edu">cs161-aut2526-staff@lists.stanford.edu</a> <b>before the add-drop deadline</b>.  That way we can let you know if we can accommodate your conflict or not and you can drop the class if you need to. </li>
		<li> If you miss an exam, and have not arranged something with us ahead of time, your options are (a) receive a zero on the exam; or (b) take an incomplete in the class and take an analogous exam/quiz with a section of CS161 later this academic year. <b>We will not have a scheduled alternate-time exam</b>. </li>
		<li> Note that two of the exams are during class.  This means that if you are enrolled in another class that meets at the same time, you will need to miss your other class on those days.  It is your responsibility to make sure that your other instructor is okay with this <b>before the add-drop deadline</b></li>.

Throughout the quarter, there will be opportunities to get "bonus points" (for example, extra problems on homework sets, the Bug Bounty Policy below; we will also award a bonus point for extremely nice solutions to normal homework problems). These points are not officially worth anything. However, at the end of the quarter, if your numerical grade puts you near to a letter-grade cut-off then if you have lots of bonus points (compared to your classmates near to you in the grade distribution) you may be "bumped" above the cut-off. (You cannot be bumped down.) For example, if your numerical grade is 0.814 and the cut-off for an A- is 0.820, then bonus points could promote you from a B+ to an A-.

<p> We hope that all course materials are bug-free. However, if you find an error in course materials (slides, iPython notebooks, or PSETs), point it out to us! (Post on Ed). The first finder of each error (that affects understanding) will get one bonus point. (See above for how bonus points will be applied).</p>

<p>
"Errors that affect understanding" include pretty much anything other than little tpyos in wrds -- although we'd be grateful if you point those out too. For example, if there is incorrect arithmetic on a slide, or indexing errors in pseudocode, or a conceptual error (without a disclaimer), or if there's some piece of crucial information that's missing from a problem, those all count as errors that affect understanding. Please point these out to us! You'll help us, your classmates, and yourself (via bonus points). It's a win-win-win situation!

We all make mistakes, even while grading.  If you think that a grader has made a mistake, you are welcome to submit a regrade request within the window allowed on gradescope.  However, please keep in mind the following guidelines:
<ul>
	<li> A valid regrade request is one where a grader may have missed something in your answer.  For example "I was marked wrong, but my answer matches that in the solutions" or "the grader said my algorithm doesn't work on XXX example, but I implemented it and it does work on that example", "the grader missed part of my work on a second page" are all valid regrade requests.  <b>"I disagree with the rubric" or "I feel like I deserve more partial credit" are not a valid regrade requests.</b></li>
	<li> If you submit a regrade request, we may regrade your entire assignment (whether or not you get points back).   In particular, if you submit a regrade request, you are not guaranteed that your score will weakly increase.
