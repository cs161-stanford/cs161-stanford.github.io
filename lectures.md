# Lectures

This page contains lecture materials.  Some notes:
<ul>
<li> <b> Future Lectures </b> Are still in draft form and may have broken links. </li>
<li> <b> IPython Notebooks: </b> In most browsers, use right-click and save-as to download the .ipynb and .py files. All IPython notebooks will assume you are using Python 3.
</li>
<li> <b> Videos </b> can be found on Canvas.
<ul> <li> Note about recordings: Video cameras located in the back of the room will capture the instructor presentations in this course. For your convenience, you can access these recordings by logging into the course Canvas site. These recordings might be reused in other Stanford courses, viewed by other Stanford students, faculty, or staff, or used for other education and research purposes. Note that while the cameras are positioned with the intention of recording only the instructor, occasionally a part of your image or voice might be incidentally captured. If you have questions, please contact a member of the teaching team. </li></ul>
<li><b> What are all these things for? </b>
<ul>
<li> The slides/lecture videos are the best resource for what actually happened in lecture. </li>
<li> The reading assignments have mathematical details the slides may be missing. You should do the reading assignments, either before or after class, to make sure you get these missing details. </li>
<li> The IPython Notebooks have implementation details that the slides may be missing. They are there in case you want to play around with them or double-check something about implementation, but they are not required. </li>
</ul>
